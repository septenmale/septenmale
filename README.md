# 👋 Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm an **iOS Developer** passionate about building user-friendly and visually appealing applications. I enjoy what I do and am constantly striving to improve my skills and create **clean, maintainable code**.

### 🌟 A little about me:
- 💻 I specialize in developing iOS apps using Swift.
- 🎯 I’m committed to writing clean, scalable, and efficient code.
- 📚 Lifelong learner — always exploring new tools, technologies, and best practices.
- 🤝 Open to collaboration and eager to connect with like-minded developers.

### 🚀 Currently Working On

I’m currently part of a **team project** focused on building a FakeNFT iOS app — a multi-screen application that allows users to browse, buy, and manage NFTs in a simulated marketplace.
We’re working with **Kanban board workflow**, clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and modern technologies such as SwiftUI, MVVM, and API integration.
